# AAC Cruiserweight M2 (Savage)

[Game8](https://game8.jp/ff14/681086) has gone with the "new FFO" strat, which is
essentially Lucrezia's strategy combined with Woops' method to resolve the adds.

N.B: Game8 updated the Magma positions to pair one ranged DPS with one healer on each
island instead of having both healers on the same island. The macros below reflect this
change.
