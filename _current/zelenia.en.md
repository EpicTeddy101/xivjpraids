  <b>[Roseblood: 4th Bloom]</b> Why are we taking so much damage at the final

      <p>This is an 8-man stack. Although the party is split up from breaking 
      the tethers, you can connect the stack damage together via the red 
      tiles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The healer with the AoE should hit the outer "south" side red tile
        with their AoE.</li>
        <li>The DPS should stand on the outer "south" side red tile to 
        <em>also</em> share in that damage.</li>
      </ul>
