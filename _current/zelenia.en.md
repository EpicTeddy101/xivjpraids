## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Roseblood: 3rd Bloom]</b> Does the ST necessarily <em>have</em> to take
  the south tower on the outer tile where the pip is?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>No! The rose players colour the inner tiles red, which effectively 
      <em>extends</em> the tower to include the three inner tiles as well, so
      the ST can go to the inner tiles to be in melee range and still take the
      south tower.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Troubleshooting

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Roseblood: 4th Bloom]</b> How did the rose team die to <em>Alexandrian 
  Lightning III</em>?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The four rose players connect the red tiles together south.</p>
      <p>If one of the non-rose players hit this connected region with their 
      AoE, it also hits the four rose players, killing them.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>

<summary>
  <b>[Roseblood: 4th Bloom]</b> Why are we taking so much damage at the final 
  stack?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>This is an 8-man stack. Although the party is split up from breaking 
      the tethers, you can connect the stack damage together via the red 
      tiles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The healer with the AoE should hit the outer "south" side red tile
        with their AoE.</li>
        <li>The DPS should stand on the outer "south" side red tile to 
        <em>also</em> share in that damage.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
